In this project we will be building a calculator with all the basic functions calculators must have... right?

Almost everything is done, only buttons missing functions are MRC, M- and M+.

Pseudocode:
1- Calculator must add, substract, multiply and divide.
2- Create structure in html
3- Style structure in css
4- Calculator must have display
5- Storing numbers inside buttons for operations
6- Check for bugs
